# Vision

**See exactly what happens inside your API.**

Vision shows you the complete journey of every request: which database queries ran, how long each step took, what data was sent and received. When something breaks, you click the failed request and see exactly where and why.

```
Before: Something's slow. Add console.log. Restart. Check logs. Repeat.
After:  Open Vision. Click the slow request. See the waterfall. Fix it.
```

---

## 30-Second Demo

**1. Add Vision to your app (2 lines):**

```typescript
import { visionAdapter, enableAutoDiscovery } from '@getvision/adapter-hono'

app.use('*', visionAdapter())
enableAutoDiscovery(app)
```

**2. Make a request to your API**

**3. Open `localhost:9500` and click the request:**

```
GET /users/123 (245ms)
├── middleware.auth (5ms)
├── handler (235ms)
│   ├── db.select.users (12ms)
│   ├── db.select.orders (180ms) ← Found it! This query is slow
│   └── transform (40ms)
└── response (5ms)
```

**You immediately see:** The orders query takes 180ms. That's the problem.

No console.log. No guessing. Just click and see.

## What Vision Shows You

### Request Waterfall

See every operation inside your request:

- **HTTP handling** - method, path, status, timing
- **Database queries** - which queries ran, how long each took
- **External API calls** - requests to Stripe, SendGrid, etc.
- **Custom operations** - anything you wrap in a span

### Request & Response Data

See exactly what was sent and received:

- Full request headers and body
- Full response headers and body
- Validation errors with field-level detail
- Error stack traces

### Auto-Discovered Routes

All your endpoints appear automatically:

- Grouped by service (`/users/*` → Users, `/orders/*` → Orders)
- Input/output schemas extracted from Zod
- Ready to test in the API Explorer

### Live Logs

Your `console.log` calls appear in the dashboard:

- Correlated with the request that logged them
- Searchable and filterable
- No more scrolling through terminal output

## Two Ways to Use Vision

### Add to Existing App

Already have a Hono, Fastify, or Express app? Add Vision in 2 lines:

```bash
npm install @getvision/adapter-hono  # or adapter-fastify, adapter-express
```

```typescript
import { Hono } from 'hono'
import { visionAdapter, enableAutoDiscovery } from '@getvision/adapter-hono'

const app = new Hono()

app.use('*', visionAdapter())
enableAutoDiscovery(app)

// Your existing routes work as-is
app.get('/users/:id', async (c) => {
  const user = await db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, id))
  return c.json(user)
})
```

**Works with:**
- Hono (`@getvision/adapter-hono`)
- Fastify (`@getvision/adapter-fastify`)
- Express (`@getvision/adapter-express`)
- More coming: NestJS, Elysia, tRPC, GraphQL

### Start New with Vision Server

Building something new? Vision Server gives you observability from the start:

```bash
npm install @getvision/server
```

```typescript
import { Vision } from '@getvision/server'
import { z } from 'zod'

const app = new Vision({
  service: { name: 'My API' }
})

app.service('users')
  .endpoint('GET', '/users/:id', {
    input: z.object({ id: z.string() }),
    output: z.object({ id: z.string(), name: z.string() })
  }, async ({ id }, c) => {
    // c.span() is built in
    const user = c.span('db.select', { 'db.table': 'users' }, () => {
      return db.select().from(users).where(eq(users.id, id))
    })
    return user
  })

app.start(3000)
```

**Vision Server includes:**
- Built-in tracing with `c.span()`
- Type-safe validation with Zod
- Event-driven pub/sub with Inngest
- Cron jobs
- File-based routing

## Which Should I Use?

| Scenario | Use This |
|----------|----------|
| I have an existing Hono/Fastify/Express app | **Adapters** - add 2 lines, done |
| I'm starting a new API project | **Vision Server** - everything built in |
| I want to try Vision quickly | **Adapters** - lower friction |
| I want structured services + events + cron | **Vision Server** - batteries included |

Both give you the same dashboard. The difference is how much is built-in.

## Why Not Just Use console.log?

You can. But:

| Problem | console.log | Vision |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| "Which query is slow?" | Add timing logs around each query | Click request, see waterfall |
| "What was in the request body?" | `console.log(req.body)` | Already captured |
| "Did the cache hit?" | Add log, restart, test | Already captured as span |
| "What happened in production staging?" | Scroll through terminal | Open dashboard, click trace |
| "Which request caused this error?" | Hope you logged enough context | Error is attached to trace |

Vision captures everything automatically. You look at what you need, when you need it.

## Why Not DataDog / NewRelic?

Those are great for production monitoring. Vision is for **development**:

| | Vision | DataDog/NewRelic |
|---|--------|------------------|
| Cost | Free, open source | $50+/month |
| Setup | 2 lines of code | SDK + config + agent |
| Data | Stays on your machine | Sent to cloud |
| Focus | Debugging during dev | Production monitoring |
| UI | Local dashboard | Cloud dashboard |

Use Vision during development. Add production APM when you need it.
